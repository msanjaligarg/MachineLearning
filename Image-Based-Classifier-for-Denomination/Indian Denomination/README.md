# Image-Based Classification of Indian Currency Notes using Classical, Quantum, and Hybrid ML

## Objective

Classify images of ₹100 and ₹200 Indian currency notes using three machine learning approaches:

- Traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Quantum CNN (QCNN)
- Hybrid CNN integrated with Quantum Machine Learning (CNN+QML)

Each model is evaluated using a consistent set of 10 performance metrics to enable meaningful comparison.


##  Workflow Overview

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Data Collection & Preprocessing** | Currency note image dataset (real or synthetic), resized and normalized |
| **2. Feature Engineering** | Raw pixel or extracted visual features |
| **3. Model Training** | Traditional CNN, Quantum CNN, and Hybrid CNN+QML |
| **4. Evaluation** | Apply 10 performance metrics |
| **5. Analysis** | Compare results and interpret metrics |
